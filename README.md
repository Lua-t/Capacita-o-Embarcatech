SmartLed â€“ Smart Lighting System

SmartLed is a smart lighting system developed with the BitDogLab board and the Raspberry Pi Pico W, as part of the EmbarcaTech training program final project.

The goal of this project is to provide remote Web control of lighting, offering:

- ðŸŒˆ Color control (RGB)

- ðŸ”† Light intensity adjustment (dimmer)

-âš¡ Energy consumption monitoring

-ðŸ”Œ On/Off switching

All features are managed through a responsive Web interface, making the system simple, practical, and fully connected.

 Features

- RGB color control: select the light color directly from the browser.

- Light dimming: fine-tune the brightness.

- Energy monitoring: track energy consumption in real time.

- Remote On/Off: complete control via the Web interface.

User-friendly interface: just access the Pico Wâ€™s IP address on your network.

Technologies

- Board: BitDogLab
- Language: microPython
